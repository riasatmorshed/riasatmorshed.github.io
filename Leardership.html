									<h3 class="major">Debating Club</h3>
									<p>General Secretary, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BUETDebatingClub">BUET Debating Club(BUETDC)</a><br>
									<b>Timeline:</b> November, 2020- May, 2022 <br>
									Before being elected as the General Secretary, I also served as "Publication Secretary", "Joint Secretary" respectively at the same club.<br>
									During my tenure at BUET Debating Club, I had undertaken some of the projects that showcase my leadership qualities.<br>
									Some of them are as follows:

										<h3 class="major">Media-Scape Deep Dive: A Panel Discussion on Digital Media</h3>
										<p>During my time at BUET Debating Club, I always fostered a culture of critical thinking, study circle and discursive sessions. Not only that, I also tried to collaborate with other clubs from the campus. For instance, for this program, I took the initiave of involving our university film club <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bfs.buet">BUET Film Society</a> in this project. This project was a panel discussion consisting four of the most prominent and educational content creators and YouTubers in our country.
											We, in details, discussed the idea of digital media and how it is shaping our notion of media, as we know it. I, along with the then president of the club moderated the session. 
											I lead organizing the session and was the main liaison person with another collaborator on behalf of my club. The video-footage of the program can be found here.  <a href="#" target="_blank">Click here</a>

										<h3 class="major">BUET Debating Club Dialectics: A Study Circle on Contemporary Issues</h3>
										<p>One of the notable works I did while I was general secretary of BUET Debating Club, is leading a study-circle, called, "BUETDC Dialectics". The session used to be held periodically and it covered almost all the concurrent issues at hand. It did not limit itself to political or economical issues only, but also to sports, films, pop-culture as well. An important part of this project was documentation and I also managed the documentation team. <br>

										<h3 class="major">Editor of the annual magazine</h3>
										<p> I have contributed to all the publications of BUET Debating Club. I actively took part in proofreading, supervising, and interviewing the expert professionals, from engineers to economists on various issues.
											The picture attached is taken after interviewing Professor Dr. Ainun Nishat, who is the most prolific person in the field of Water Resource Engineering. He is also one of the chief advisors of Padma Bridge- which is the largest infrustructural project of Bangladesh.

										<h3 class="major">Volunteering</h3>
										<p>One of the key-aspects of my leadership activism is making education more accessible and as open-source as possible. That is why I make free educational content online so that economic or social background cannot set a barrier for those who want to seek them.<br>
										This is a video on "Graduate Record Examination" that I made sharing my exam-strategies and insights. This video can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di0BdxOqqtw&t=20s" target="_blank">Click here.</a> </p>

										<h3 class="major">Public Speaking</h3>
										<p>I have been a debater since my high school. I have conducted numerous training sessions among the students. Few of the videos where I conducted session
											for public speaking and debating can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgVxmgPY0d4&t=686s" target="_blank">Click here.</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmwyy7eoP5I&t=3890s" target="_blank">Click here</a><br>
											I have also actively took part in departmental fest and activities, for example, anchoring in festivals, delivering speeches in a gathering and so on.

										<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
											Why do we use it?
											
											It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
