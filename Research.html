									<h3 class="major">Undergraduate Thesis</h3>
									<p>I Completed my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of <a href="http://zobair.buet.ac.bd/" target="_blank">Professor Dr. Zobair Ibn Awal</a>.<br> <b>Title: </b>Probabilistic Analysis of Grounding near the Waterway of Rampal Power Plant in Bangladesh for Random ship-speeds<br>
										<b>Abstract: </b>Rampal Power Plant is a coal-fired power station that is being built near the Sundarbans which is a UNSECO World Heritage Site and world’s largest mangrove forest. It is said to be the largest thermal power plant if goes to operation, and will require as much as 4.72 million coal per year.1 Bulk carriers with the size of about 10000 DWT2 will be the prime mode of vessels transporting the fuel. The number of vessels that will be plying through is approximated around 600 ships per year3. Situated at an ecologically sensitive area, extra caution is called for carrying fuel in case of marine accidents. With this massive freight being operated en route, a probabilistic analysis of grounding of the bulk carriers, varying with ship speed is evaluated. In order to determine the course of a vessel, a maneuvering model- “Nomoto Model” is considered to be the governing equation. Upon solving the equation using Runge-Kutta 2nd order method, a computer-code is developed using Python to simulate trajectory of a ship. Initial position of the ship is randomized  and speed of the ship is varied to plot the trajectories after being applied to an evasive maneuvering command. Then, the plotted curves are observed to check whether the ship can avoid grounding. Finally, probability of grounding corresponding to each speed is determined that can provide insight to grounding phenomena at waterways near “Rampal Power Plant”. The study finds at a lower speed, i.e., 1-5 knots, ships running at 3 knots and at a higher speed of 5-10 knots, ships running at 7 knots and 9 knots are more prone to grounding. As a result, it is suggested to keep track of even lower ship-speeds that do not seem to cause accidents otherwise.<br>
